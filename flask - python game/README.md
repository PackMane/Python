Welcome to my game developed for CS50 (Connect Tic Tac). I realize it's not tremendous but it definitely tested my limits. I did look at code online to get a feel for making games with Python.

Open all the source code in CS50 IDE. Type `flask run` in the terminal and follow the link the server provides.


Connect4*

Select the Connect4 game from the homepage by clicking the blue and yellow button. This should redirect to the Connect4 page with an empty board.

The player that goes first is randomly chosen. Whenever the loading circle appears, this indicates the bot is deciding where to move. When the loading circle disappears, it is the user's turn
to move.

To move, use the mouse and click on the column you wish to drop a piece on the Connect4 board. An 'O' will appear in the appropriate location.

A message indicating the result of the game will appear at the top of the screen once the game is complete.

To replay or choose another game, click the Back button, which will return to the home screen.
